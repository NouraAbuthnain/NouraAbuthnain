**Hi, I’m Noura Abuthnain 👋**

I have a Computer Science background with experience in machine learning and deep learning, including work in natural language processing and computer vision. My interests focus on applied, data-driven AI systems and understanding how different models behave when applied to real datasets.

My work involves model comparison, experimentation, and evaluation of learning-based systems. I also have experience translating technical ideas into clear, usable implementations, informed by additional experience in UX/UI design and frontend–backend development.
